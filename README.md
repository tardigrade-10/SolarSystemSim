# SolarSystemSim
A somewhat realistic animation of **Solar System**

Program simulating almost realistic Solar System showing power and beauty of computer simulation in the study of Astronomy.
I read about this project few days ago, researched and worked on it for sometime, modified and handled some errors and it turned out pretty good as expected.
Will try to make a simulation for all eights planets soon. Visualizing that is pretty hard because the orbital radius becomes very large (>5.3 times that of Earth) starting from Jupiter so including planets after Mars in the animation makes the inner planets very small compared to the outer ones.)
